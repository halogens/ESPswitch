# ESPswitch
***Use your webpage to turn on or turn off your devices at home or anywhere from everywhere.***

Simple algorithm of this system works like this;
esp8266 goes to a website if website content is "1" the device which is connected to esp turns or stays on ,if it is "2" it goes dark.
I am able to change the website which esp8266 visits, anywhere in the world by internet.
So i have a a MOSFET,a relay,a nodemcu esp8266,internet connection,a device to control,a webpage and a database(for security i use a database which stores my password and id. you can use a simple php code as well in your private folder in your ftp server. ) .
***phpsecure folder will have no public access.*** 
I have used Aruino IDE for the nodemcu esp.
