This is designed for Nodemcu esp8266 module.
Algorithm will work with every microcontroller which has at least two GPIO pins and a WiFi connection.
If your device only have one GPIO pin, do not use the restart function then you will be able the use this code as well.
In my system device casuses network problems after long use so I have added a restart function which restarts the device every 5 hours by a short circle.
I have used a MOSFET which gate connected to D0, restart and ground connected to other legs of mosfet.
